# Regiment Data Analysis

This project involves the analysis of regiment-related data using Python and the Pandas library. The dataset provides information about different regiments, companies, and performance scores.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Python code for analyzing regiment-related data using the Pandas library. The analysis includes steps to create a DataFrame, group and aggregate data, and derive various statistics related to pre-test scores and observations for each regiment and company. The primary goals of this project are:

- Create a DataFrame with regiment-related data.
- Calculate the mean pre-test score for the regiment "Nighthawks."
- Present general statistics by company.
- Calculate the mean pre-test score for each company.
- Calculate the mean pre-test scores grouped by regiment and company.
- Present the mean pre-test scores grouped by regiment and company without hierarchical indexing.
- Group the entire DataFrame by regiment and company.
- Determine the number of observations in each regiment and company.
- Iterate over a group and print the name and data from each regiment.

## Analysis Steps

1. Import the necessary libraries, including Pandas and NumPy.
2. Create a DataFrame with regiment-related data using a dictionary.
3. Assign the DataFrame to a variable named `regiment` and name each column.
4. Calculate the mean pre-test score for the regiment "Nighthawks."
5. Present general statistics by company using grouping and describe.
6. Calculate the mean pre-test score for each company using grouping.
7. Calculate the mean pre-test scores grouped by regiment and company.
8. Present the mean pre-test scores grouped by regiment and company without hierarchical indexing.
9. Group the entire DataFrame by regiment and company.
10. Determine the number of observations in each regiment and company.
11. Iterate over a group and print the name and data from each regiment.
